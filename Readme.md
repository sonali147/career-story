# Career Story Builder

A comprehensive daily work logging and career development report generation application built with FastAPI backend and Electron frontend. Track your daily accomplishments, reflect on your work, and generate AI-powered career development reports using OpenAI's GPT models.

## ÔøΩÔøΩ Features

### Daily Work Logging
- **Project Tracking**: Log work by project/sprint
- **Task Management**: Record completed tasks and plan future work
- **Blocker Documentation**: Track impediments and challenges
- **Reflection System**: Capture what went well and areas for improvement
- **Flexible Input**: Required fields for essential data, optional fields for detailed insights

### AI-Powered Report Generation
- **STAR Story Seeds**: Automatically identify accomplishments and format them using the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
- **Growth Analysis**: Analyze blockers and improvement areas to identify development opportunities
- **Learning Plans**: Generate actionable learning goals based on your work patterns
- **Professional Formatting**: Reports generated in clean Markdown format

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application consists of two main components:

### Backend (`career-story-backend/`)
- **FastAPI** web server providing REST API endpoints
- **OpenAI Integration** for AI-powered report generation
- **File-based Storage** for daily logs (Markdown format)
- **CORS-enabled** for frontend communication

### Frontend (`career-story-frontend/`)
- **Electron** desktop application
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** interface
- **Responsive Design** with two-column layout
- **Real-time API Communication** with backend

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 16+
- OpenAI API Key

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd career-story
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
cd career-story-backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv openai

# Set up environment variables
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here" > .env
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd ../career-story-frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### 1. Start the Backend Server
```bash
cd career-story-backend
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

The backend will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

### 2. Start the Frontend Application
```bash
cd career-story-frontend
npm start
```

This will launch the Electron desktop application.

## üìù Example Log Entry

```markdown
# Daily Log: 2024-01-15
**Name:** Sonali Gupta
**Project / Sprint:** Avyott

### ‚úÖ Tasks Completed Today
* Implemented user authentication system
* Fixed bug in payment processing
* Reviewed code for team members

### üìã Tasks Planned for Tomorrow
* Add unit tests for authentication
* Optimize database queries

### üöß Blockers
* Waiting for API documentation from third-party service

### üí≠ Reflection
**What went well:** Successfully debugged a complex payment issue that was blocking the team.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend won't start**: Ensure Python virtual environment is activated and all dependencies are installed
2. **Frontend won't connect**: Verify backend is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
3. **Report generation fails**: Check that your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
4. **CORS errors**: Ensure backend CORS middleware is properly configured

### Getting Help

- Check the FastAPI documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` for API details
- Review the browser console for frontend errors
- Check backend logs for server-side issues
